                The ToK, WoKs and the question 'how can we know and how can we know' more made me think a lot about things around me.

               I really enjoyed participating in a debate about social media, since debate is one of the things I enjoy and do often.

               I think it's really important to understand that there will be cultural differences when you study abroad (since it's not just you and students from the same country anymore) - and I think May and Kat emphasized that in the Campfire session. They also helped me understand about how I can blend into an international community (if I were to study abroad), but also not make my personal identity fade away. I also learned more about the good AND bad sides of cultural differences, and the fact that we'll have to face obstacles regarding this, in one way or another.
